# Customer Churn Analysis

A comprehensive project analyzing customer churn using Python for data processing and machine learning, and Power BI for visualization.

---

## 📌 Overview

Customer churn analysis is a critical process that helps businesses understand why customers leave and how to retain them. This project utilizes **Python** and **Power BI** to analyze churn patterns, visualize insights, and predict potential churn using machine learning models.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📊 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Uncovering trends and correlations in churn behavior.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models** – Implementing predictive models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- 📈 **Power BI Dashboards** – Creating interactive visualizations for better business insights.
- 📉 **Churn Prediction** – Identifying high-risk customers to improve retention strategies.
